# Refactor checkpoint QA criteria v1

The gated checkpoint report must satisfy every condition below.

1. It identifies the executing prompt, the specification version, the baseline
   commit, the starting dirty state, and the exact artifact version being judged.
2. It lists every changed, created, moved, and deleted path and demonstrates that
   each change is within the prompt's authorized mutation boundary. Pre-existing
   user changes remain byte-for-byte outside the checkpoint delta.
3. It records every prompt TEST with its exact command or inspection procedure,
   exit status, material output, and a PASS or FAIL conclusion supported by that
   evidence. A skipped, unavailable, or inconclusive check is not PASS.
4. It demonstrates the prompt's prerequisites, explicit non-targets, stop
   conditions, and rollback procedure were honored. No successor prompt's mutation
   authority may be borrowed by the current checkpoint.
5. It identifies residual old identities, paths, imports, output consumers, schema
   references, or failures relevant to the prompt and classifies each as resolved,
   a recorded exception, pre-existing, or a blocker. Silent residuals are defects.
6. It includes the post-change git status and a reviewable diff or immutable digest
   for every deliverable, plus the verification result at the rollback checkpoint.
7. It does not claim completion when evidence is missing, collection is incomplete,
   commands failed, the QA transport is unavailable, or the independent gate has
   not produced a witnessed and verified `QA_PASSED` result.
