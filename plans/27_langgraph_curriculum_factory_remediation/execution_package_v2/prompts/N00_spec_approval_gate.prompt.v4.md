# GOAL

Prove that execution package v2 has one corrected, independently verified,
explicitly user-approved specification authority before any implementation
begins. This is package v2's counterpart of
`plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/prompts/N00_spec_approval_gate.prompt.v1.md`,
which gated the v1 attempt through its `BLOCKED` `N20_PROVIDER_TRANSPORT`
result, and of
`plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/prompts/N00_spec_approval_gate.prompt.v2.md`,
which gated the first, failed execution-package correction
(`implementation.graph.v2.yaml`, preserved immutable together with its QA
session and `PKG-QA-001` finding). Those v1 and v2 results and evidence
remain untouched, immutable, and readable as historical record — this node
does not supersede them in place, it gates a new, independent package. This
v4 prompt corrects `N00_spec_approval_gate.prompt.v3.md`, which named a
stale, nonexistent graph filename left over from an earlier package
generation instead of this package's actually enforced and bound graph,
`implementation.graph.v4.yaml` — the exact class of defect an
independent QA round found in this package's own release-candidate process
(`RC1-QA-001`). The v3 file is preserved unchanged as historical record.

This node is a gate, not a specification-writing or graph-writing task. Do
not create, edit, approve, or repair the v4 specification artifact, this
package's own graph, QA evidence, an approval record, runtime, tests,
policy, or any Plan 26/Run 27 v1 or failed-v2 historical artifact. Its only
authorized writes are its own result and evidence directory under
`execution_package_v2/results/`.

# TEST

1. Hash Plan 26 v1
   (`44e63e6271cae25f14f0bc970c598d1c15da41b67ae3cdf811bbb2f2303536e6`) and
   v2 (`99052a181052bbbaf8077a152af22db6f248d552f38dd73302a3c34abc11b758`)
   and require both to still match; neither is edited by this or any prior
   correction task.
2. Require the specification artifact
   `plans/26_langgraph_curriculum_factory/spec/v3/langgraph_curriculum_factory.spec.v4.md`
   (sha256 `e14df5a36ce12d700fe9fc4aa4aea466771bc89f31bc6e9d49f812c147b1bb3c`
   — physically named `.v4.md` by the QA gate's own round-lineage numbering
   after a round-1 fix; the document is specification v3 and its own header
   says so) to exist and to correct v2 at the exact hash above, not v1.
3. Read that specification's own independent QA session
   (`plans/26_langgraph_curriculum_factory/spec/v3/QA/`, session
   `019ffbeb-3f45-7440-a83e-aa560938dc98`). Require witnessed,
   hash-chain-valid `QA_PASSED` by re-running the QA gate's own `verify`
   command read-only; prose asserting that QA ran is not evidence.
4. Require this package's own execution-package QA result
   (`execution_package_v2/QA/`) to exist with the same witnessed,
   hash-chain-valid `QA_PASSED` discipline, verified the same way.
5. Require `execution_package_v2/implementation.graph.v4.yaml` to exist, to
   declare `version: 2`, to validate via
   `python3 plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/execution_package_v2/tools/validate_plan_v2.py`,
   and to declare `source_spec` as the specification path above.
6. Validate a new `execution_package_v2/contracts/spec_approval.v1.yaml`
   against `plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/schemas/spec_approval.schema.v1.json`
   with format checking enabled. (The schema itself is frozen and
   unversioned per `rules.frozen_before_entry`; only the approval record is
   new to this package.)
7. Recompute digests and require exact equality across: the specification
   file, its QA verification artifact hash, this package's graph file, this
   package's QA verification artifact hash, and the corresponding hashes
   bound inside the approval record.
8. Require the approval record to authorize `plan27_implementation_remediation`
   and to carry the exact Claude model/effort decision already supplied by
   the user for `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED-01`, unchanged from
   `plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/contracts/spec_approval.v1.yaml`'s
   `approval_statement`.
9. Enumerate every `USER_DECISION_REQUIRED` item in the specification. If
   any affects a node's intended implementation and lacks a separately
   recorded answer, block.
10. Prove no Run 27 v1 result, evidence file, receipt, patch, log, the v1
    execution graph, the failed `implementation.graph.v2.yaml` and its QA
    session, runtime, test, policy, or model-job file was changed by this
    node.
11. Record command output and hashes under
    `execution_package_v2/results/evidence/N00_SPEC_APPROVAL_GATE/` and emit
    a JSON result conforming to
    `plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/schemas/node_result.schema.v1.json`.

The only success outcome is `PASSED`. Missing, inconsistent, unverifiable, or
unapproved inputs produce `BLOCKED_SPEC_NOT_APPROVED`. An integrity or tool
defect produces `BLOCKED`.

# LOOP

Do not repair a failed approval gate. Re-run read-only checks once to rule
out a transient read error. If the same condition remains, write the honest
result and stop the graph. Never infer user approval from the existence of
this package's scaffold, from a prior agent's report of passing digests, or
from a request to prepare this package — approval binds the exact digests
recorded in the approval record, supplied by the user after seeing them, not
before.
