"""Package-v2 node-scoped and complete-tree forbidden-reference scanner.

This is execution package v2's own versioned entry point, required because
the parent v1 controller module
(``plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/controller/check_forbidden_production_refs.py``)
must not be edited by this package (see this package's ``implementation.graph.v6.yaml``
header). It imports that module's scan logic read-only and does not duplicate
or reimplement the term/credential/guard-region/occurrence rules.

Why this file exists rather than reusing ``--node`` on the parent module
directly: the first execution-package correction
(``implementation.graph.v2.yaml``, preserved immutable at
plans/27_langgraph_curriculum_factory_remediation/QA/, finding ``PKG-QA-001``)
added ``--node`` to the parent module in place, but every node-scoped
verification command in that graph omitted ``--graph``, so the extended
scanner silently defaulted to the *parent* v1 graph
(``implementation.graph.v1.yaml`` in the plan root) and therefore scanned the
v1 write sets, not the corrected v2 ones -- a stale-default failure. This
package fixes that class of defect at the root, in two independent ways:

1. Every node-scoped verification command in this package's graph passes
   ``--graph <this package's graph path>`` explicitly (enforced by
   ``tools/validate_plan_v2.py``, which rejects a node-scoped scan command
   that omits it).
2. Independently, if ``--graph`` is ever omitted, this script's own default
   is this package's own graph file, never the parent v1 graph -- so an
   omitted flag fails safe onto the correct write sets rather than silently
   falling back onto stale ones.

Node mode scans the intersection of the named node's declared writable
active files with the existing production/test scan roots: it calls the
parent module's whole-tree ``scan_production``/``scan_tests`` unmodified (so
every term, credential, guard-region, and occurrence rule is exactly as
strict as the whole-tree scopes already are), then narrows the scanned-file
and violation lists to paths covered by the node's own write set. It cannot
scan more broadly than the whole-tree scopes would, and it cannot skip a
file within the node's write set that either whole-tree scope would have
scanned, because it starts from that exact whole-tree result and only
removes files outside the node's ownership.

Complete-tree mode (no ``--node``) is the unmodified parent whole-tree scan,
preserving the original production plus active-test semantics byte for byte.
